## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git https://github.com/shivam367/WanderAI.git
    cd WanderAI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project by copying `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env .env.local
    ```
    You will need to add your Google AI API key to this file for Genkit to function:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```
    Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

-   `npm run dev`
    Runs the Next.js app in development mode with Turbopack. Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to view it in the browser.
    The Genkit flows will be available via the Next.js server.

-   `npm run genkit:dev`
    Starts the Genkit development server locally (useful for testing flows independently, though in this setup, flows are primarily accessed via the Next.js app).
    Flows can be inspected at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port Genkit starts on).

-   `npm run genkit:watch`
    Starts the Genkit development server with file watching.

-   `npm run build`
    Builds the application for production to the `.next` folder.

-   `npm run start`
    Starts a Next.js production server.

-   `npm run lint`
    Runs ESLint to identify and fix problems in your code.

-   `npm run typecheck`
    Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.

## AI Features with Genkit

This application utilizes Genkit to power its AI functionalities. Key flows include:

-   **`extract-text-from-image.ts`**: Handles OCR. Takes an image data URI and returns extracted text.
-   **`process-text-flow.ts`**: A versatile flow for simplifying, summarizing, or generating Q&A from input text. It supports different output formats (bullet points, story) and allows for iterative refinement based on user feedback. It also generates a heading for the processed content.
-   **`study-chat.ts`**: Powers the interactive study chat. It can answer questions based on provided notes or use its general knowledge. It maintains conversation history for context.

These flows are typically invoked from the frontend components in `src/app/`. The global Genkit AI instance is configured in `src/ai/genkit.ts` using the Google AI plugin. By default, it is configured to use the `gemini-2.0-flash` model.

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Firebase App Hosting. The `apphosting.yaml` file contains the basic configuration. Firebase App Hosting will typically build and deploy the Next.js application based on this file and `package.json`.
